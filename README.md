"progetto.m" contains a thermal analysis of an electrical welder with internal generation of energy per unit volume. The transient state was taken into account and three different numerical methods are compared. The "thomas.m" functions uses the Thomas algorithm to solve the tridiagonal system that comes with some of the methods.
